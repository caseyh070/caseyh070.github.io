   </p>Tip #1: Don't be afraid to ask for help 
   <br> Tip #2: Don't do too much at once; run and check after every edit
   <br> Tip #3: Don't rely too much on help because it will cripple you later
   <br> Tip #4: Make it fun. Enjoying your work will improve its quality and make it easier
   <br> Tip #5: If you don't know how to code something, find a place where you've already coded it,
